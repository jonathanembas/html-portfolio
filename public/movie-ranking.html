<h3>Good Will Hunting</h3>
<p>My number one movie. Impacted me as a person in a lot of ways in the beginning of my 
interest in movies.</p>

<h3>The Wolf of Wall Street</h3>
<p>Leonardo Di Caprio, the best actor of all time.</p>

<h3>Gladiator</h3>
<p>The closest to a 10/10 movie in my opinion.</p>
